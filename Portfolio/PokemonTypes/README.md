Interactive Pokemon Type Weaknessess

This allows you to click on a Pokemon type and see the effectiveness compared to other types. Good for getting simple type information quickly.

How its made:

This porject was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS give it a simple yet clean design while the Javascript allows for the functionality I wanted for the final product. Allowing a user to click buttons to pull up a modal with information or close it by clicking off the modal.

Lessons Learned:

I started this porject in order to gain experience doing front-end development. I had limited JavaScript and CSS knowledge before this project and wanted to do something fun and slightly challenging to improve and learn the languages better. I learned about adding functionality to a webpage with JS as well as using it to create a modal and generate HTML within it. I also learned more about the uses of CSS and how to make a website that works on both PC and mobile devices.
